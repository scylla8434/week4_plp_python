# Week 4 PLP python Assignment

Hi there,

This is my assignment where I explored Python's file handling and error management skills. I created a program that reads a file, transforms its content, and writes it to a new file—all while gracefully handling any issues along the way. Below, I’ve explained what my project does, how I tackled the challenges, and how you can run it on your own machine.

## What This Assignment is About

In this project, I built a Python program that takes care of two main tasks:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge**  
   - The program asks the user for a source file name and then reads its contents.
   - It modifies the content in some way (I chose to convert the text to uppercase, but you could change it to do other transformations).
   - Finally, it writes the modified content to a new file specified by the user.

2. **Error Handling Lab**  
   - I ensured that the program handles errors really well. This means:
     - If the source file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, the program prints a friendly error message instead of crashing.
     - The same goes for any issues that might occur while writing to the destination file.
